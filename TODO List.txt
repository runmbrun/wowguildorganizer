A List of all the feature and bug fixes that will need to be incorportated at some point in time.  
In no particular order...


=====================
+ Updates and Fixes +
=====================

Global:
*  ADD: Dual spec functionality to the GuildMember class. 
	a. Would be able to switch back and forth as needed. (Right click functionality)
*  FIX: Tooltips - Make sure in an audit, that the correct stats are displayed, not just the base stats.
*  TEST:Items - pvp gear isn't using contexts correctly.  
	a. Example: http://us.battle.net/api/wow/item/119831
		i. Shows up in Character as vendor instead of {"id":119831,"availableContexts":["pvp-unranked"]}
*  ADD: Make sure old raids can be hidden (visible=true), or deleted.
*  ADD: Make sure new raids are added to instead of overwritten?
*  TEST:Make sure that the Refresh function removes guildies that have quit the guild.
*  ADD: Change up on the Item needed and pull the exact availables from the web
*  FIX: Only ask update question if role has changed, not spec
*  FIX: Item tooltip for Tier Pieces - show bonus or at least that it's a Tier piece
* TEST:If Guild Roster is giving different level than individual check, take the higher one.
* TEST:If Item Id + Context is not giving an item, then when it's found, add both items in the cache. (To prevent multiple internet searches each time)
* ADD: Include the date/time variable from the character and guild roster JSON data.  Use it to compare. (not working on Blizzard's side yet)
* ADD: Redo Audit - use the armory audit instead
* ADD: Get rid of Background worker and use tasks instead
* ADD: Get Tasks to run in parallel instead of serial. Test for performance.
