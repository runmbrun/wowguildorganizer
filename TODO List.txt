In no particular order...


=====================
+ Updates and Fixes +
=====================

Global:
0.  BUG: When no raid members (and probably guild members), add one and click on any new row.  Blows up.  Can't figure out where...
1.  ADD: Dual spec functionality to the GuildMember class. 
	a. Would be able to switch back and forth as needed. (Right click functionality)
2.  FIX: Tooltips - Make sure in an audit, that the correct stats are displayed, not just the base stats.
3.  TEST:Items - pvp gear isn't using contexts correctly.  
	a. Example: http://us.battle.net/api/wow/item/119831
		i. Shows up in Character as vendor instead of {"id":119831,"availableContexts":["pvp-unranked"]}
4.  TEST:Need functionality to parse wowhead.com to get boss loot table.
5.  ADD: Make sure old raids can be hidden (visible=true), or deleted.
6.  TEST:Make sure that the Refresh function removes guildies that have quit the guild.
7.  ADD: Change up on the Item needed and pull the exact availables from the web
8.  FIX: Only ask update question if role has changed, not spec
9.  FIX: Item tooltip for Tier Pieces - show bonus or at least that it's a Tier piece
10. TEST:If Guild Roster is giving different level than individual check, take the higher one.
11. TEST:If Item Id + Context is not giving an item, then when it's found, add both items in the cache. (To prevent multiple internet searches each time)
12. ADD: Include the date/time variable from the character and guild roster JSON data.  Use it to compare.
